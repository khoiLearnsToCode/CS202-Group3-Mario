mario(obj) is created inside gameworld class
everytime you want to access mario, use reference or pointer to mario in gameworld

For now, we use mario as our character in the game. Later, we will create a class Character
that will be the base class for all characters in the game.
Mario will inherit from Character class.
Need to fix all the references to mario in the code to use the Character class instead.

map is created inside gameworld class
map stores a reference to mario
